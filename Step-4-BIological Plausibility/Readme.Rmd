## step4.Rmd and step4.md 

 - Assess the spatial distribution of significant methylation probes according to their distance from genes
 - Analyze the distribution of significant methylation probes in different chromatin states using ChromHMM
 - Rank the genes based on the number of significant corresponding probes as an indicator for the multifunctionality of the gene
 - Gene set enrichment analysis to find the relationship between the number of significant probes and the complexity of gene regulation using erminR

## geneset_enrichment_analysis.md and geneset enrichment analysis.Rmd

- Please describe the geneset_enrichment_analysis.md and geneset enrichment analysis.Rmd contents in point form

## step4_files (Images Folder)

- This directory will include all the images that are involved in the Markdown file

## Data

- This directory will include a description of the data links and the data sets involved in Step 4
