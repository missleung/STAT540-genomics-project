## Data

### ROSMAP Data

- We used the ROSMAP raw data published by [synapse](https://www.synapse.org/) as the input to this step. Due to the confidentiality issues, interested scientists can directly contact synapse for downloading the data using the link below:

### rosmap_postprocV2.RData

- The data sets produced here consists of the results from Step 1. The .RData folder consists of three data sets: probes_subjects, subjects_genes, and probes_genes_distance. The probes_subjects data consists of DNA methylation probe data, subjects_genes consists of gene expression values, and probes_genes_distance consists of the distances on probes and genes where 0 represents a distance over 1Mb. Since it is too large to be uploaded in github, the data set could be found in this Google Drive Folder:
