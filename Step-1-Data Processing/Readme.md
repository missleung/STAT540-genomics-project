### ROSMAP Data

-   We used the ROSMAP raw data published by [synapse](https://www.synapse.org/) as the input to this step. Due to the confidentiality issues, interested scientists can directly contact synapse for downloading the data using the link below:

### rosmap\_postprocV2.RData

-   The data sets produced here consists of the results from Step 1. The .RData folder consists of three data sets: probes\_subjects, subjects\_genes, and probes\_genes\_distance. The probes\_subjects data consists of DNA methylation probe data, subjects\_genes consists of gene expression values, and probes\_genes\_distance consists of the distances on probes and genes where 0 represents a distance over 1Mb. Since it is too large to be uploaded in github, the data set could be found in this Google Drive Folder:
